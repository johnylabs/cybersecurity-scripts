# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Scripts in Python

Practical Python scripts for log analysis, threat detection, and automation.  
This repository showcases real-world tooling used in SOC environments, blue teaming, and basic incident response workflows.

---

## 📌 Key Objectives

- 🔁 Automate repetitive security workflows
- 📊 Parse and analyze logs for suspicious behavior
- 🧪 Build lightweight tools for reconnaissance and defense
- 🧰 Demonstrate scripting capability in operational security

## 📂 Script Index

| Script Name         | Description                                  | Status         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `hello.py`          | Environment setup confirmation               | ✅ Completed    |
| `log_parser.py`     | Parses auth logs to detect login anomalies   | 🛠️ In progress |
| `port_scanner.py`   | TCP port scanner using sockets               | ⏳ Planned      |
| `alert_trigger.py`  | Real-time alert on suspicious log entries    | ⏳ Planned      |
| `auto_blocker.py`   | IP blocker based on brute-force detection    | ⏳ Planned      |

## 🧠 Capabilities Demonstrated

- ✅ File I/O and structured log parsing
- ✅ Modular scripting and basic CLI handling
- 🧩 Regex for pattern detection (coming up)
- 📡 Socket-based scanning (next milestone)
- 🛡️ Defensive automation via IP rules or alerts

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Finalize brute-force detection pipeline
- Add notification trigger via webhook or email
- Expand to work with JSON/syslog formats
- Test tools in local honeypot or lab VM
