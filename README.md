# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Scripts Toolkit

![Lab Tested](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lab-Tested-green)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-blue)

Practical Python tools for log analysis, threat detection, and automation.  
Part of my [Home SOC Lab](https://github.com/yourusername/home-soc-lab-flump-wazuh) portfolio ‚Äî used in blue-team, SOC, and basic incident response workflows.

## Key Objectives

- Automate repetitive security workflows
- Parse and analyze logs for suspicious behavior
- Build lightweight tools for reconnaissance and defense
- Demonstrate scripting capability in operational security

## Script Index

| Script Name         | Description                                  | Status         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `hello.py`          | Environment setup confirmation               | ‚úÖ Completed    |
| `log_parser.py`     | Parses auth logs to detect login anomalies   | ‚úÖ Completed    |
| `port_scanner.py`   | TCP port scanner using sockets               | üõ†Ô∏è In progress |
| `alert_trigger.py`  | Real-time alert on suspicious log entries    | ‚è≥ Planned      |
| `auto_blocker.py`   | IP blocker based on brute-force detection    | ‚è≥ Planned      |
